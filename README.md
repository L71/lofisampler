LoFi sampler / filter / dist module
===================================

This is a Eurorack module built upon the circuits described here:

The added stuff here is Eurorack power supply circuits, an output amplifier and
some circuitry to get correct polarity on the sample rate/filter bandwidth control voltage.

It does sample and play stuff back but it's _really_ lofi as a sampler, lots of clicks at
start and stop of playback. It works better as a lofi filter or dist.
